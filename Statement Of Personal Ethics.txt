Introduction    

Hello and welcome, ladies and gentlemen, in this different statement, I would like to thank all the industrialists for being the minds of civilization.    

I always think there are people who love to work in this world. 

 

The Oxford Dictionary defines "ethics" as "the ethical principles that govern a person's behavior or activity." Morality is an important part of our daily lives, and our personal moral beliefs are responsible for many of our judgments and actions. I think there are times in everyone's life when (s) they have to choose the right alternative, distinguish between right and wrong and support what is appropriate for society as a whole, which is when the system of personal ethics comes in the picture. 

  

My personal ethics consist of qualities that always help me choose a legitimate choice in sticky situations. I am an honest person - the truth always matters to me more than anything else at any moment. Since childhood, this quality has always directed me away from the small distractions faced by many children at some point or another - cheating in class exams, stealing, for example. I've always defended what's right, and that helped me become the person I am today. 

 

I will always strive to be humble and entrenched. I will not let any medals or praise affect my position, and will always be polite to my colleagues, superiors and children. I'll make sure I don't hurt or make fun of anyone on purpose.
